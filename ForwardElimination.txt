After looping through all values of K for J = 2 your matrix will look like this...

1 1 1 | 6
0 0 1 | 3
1 2 3 | 14

When you then incrament J to 3 and loop through all of K the matrix looks like this...

1 1 1 | 6
0 0 1 | 3
0 1 2 | 8

The issue occurs when you then incrament I to 2

When dividing A[3,2] by A[2,2] you get 1/0 which is impossible thus failing to provide the answer

Better forward elimination continues to move the pivot row depending on the largest value in that column which keeps you from dividing by 0
Because when I = 2 it will switch the 2nd and 3rd row so A[2,2] != 0
